- X *Fig 1*: `selection_lylz.py` 
   
   Sgr selection using Ly-Lz and comparing to LM10 (current Fig 1 in overleaf).  Add DL17?

- X *Fig 2*: `metallicities.py`
   
   [a/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] and [Fe/H] histogram

- X *Fig 3*: `ely.py`
   
   2-panel E-Ly.  left All, right: low metallicity.  Sgr members maybe black and background in grey (background would be all giants above the SNR cut).  Show LM10 also?

- X *Fig 4*: `vgsr_lambda_feh.py`
   
   3-panel V_GSR vs. Lambda in three metallicity slices.  Show Fig 5 selections.

- X *Fig 5*: `mdf_by_vlam.py`
   
   [Fe/H] histogram for several selections in V-Lam space. Lead/Trail x Cold/Diffuse

- X *Fig 6*: `vgsr_lambda_mocks.py`
   
   V_GSR vs. Lambda H3 vs. LM10 vs. DL17 

- O *Fig 7*: `sigma_v.py`
   
   sigma-arm vs. lambda plot, with comparison to models and the literature.
