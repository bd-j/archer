- *Fig 1*: `selection_lylz.py` X
   
   Sgr selection using Ly-Lz and comparing to LM10 (current Fig 1 in overleaf).

   [a/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] and [Fe/H] histogram

- *Fig 3*: `ely.py`
   
   2-panel E-Ly.  left All, right: low metallicity.  Sgr members maybe black and background in grey (background would be all giants above the SNR cut).  Show LM10 also?

- *Fig 4*: `vgsr_lambda_feh.py`
   
   3-panel V_GSR vs. Lambda in three metallicity slices.  Show Fig 5 selections.

- *Fig 5*: `mdf_byfeh.py`
   
   [Fe/H] histogram for several selections in V-Lam space.
